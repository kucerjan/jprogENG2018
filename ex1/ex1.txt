1) Write a method that reads two numbers (from standard input) and prints the sum, difference,  product, quotientâ€¦: a+b, a-b, a/b, a*b  
2) Write a method that for a given radius computes the area of a circle and its perimeter. Format the output to 3 digits after the decimal point.
3) Write a method that for a given integer number of interval <1,7> returns the name of day in the week: Monday,...,Sunday.
... for all the upper three exercises write also a program that demonstrates the usage of your new methods
4) Write a program that reads the integer numbers from stdin (one number per line). Input ends with a single zero being entered.
   The program computes:
	-arithmetic average, or prints an error if unable to compute
	-prints the second biggest and second smallest element
	-figures out a type of entered sequence (constant,increasing,non-increasing,decreasing, non-decreasing)
5) Write a program that computes a prime factorization of a given number.
